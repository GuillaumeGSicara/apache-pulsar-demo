## Clients

This repo contains example of a python pulsar client.

In this repo we will setup a client to:
- **Producer**: Produce to a topic and send messages to the topic queue
- **Reader***: Read from the queue and move the cursor on different messages
- **Consumer**: Consume from a topic and ackowledge that the message has been read 

Make sure to follow the steps of the top level `README.md` to setup your pulsar cluster and UI manager
